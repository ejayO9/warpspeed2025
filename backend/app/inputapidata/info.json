Assuming an estimated monthly income of ₹1.2 L (rental + investment yield), and keeping a ₹20 L emergency buffer, we compare several options: (A) high down payment of ₹30 L + ₹15 L home loan → EMI ~₹18.6k but ties up more cash; (B) moderate down payment ₹22.5 L + ₹22.5 L home loan over 8 years at ~9% → EMI ~₹31.4k, finishes by age ~70, retains buffer and corpus; (C) all-cash uses ₹45 L but reduces corpus significantly; (D) loan-against-securities is affordable EMI but high interest and market risk. Option B is recommended: EMI fits comfortably within income, tenure aligns with age policies, and preserves buffer/investment. Next steps: verify lender acceptance of rental/investment income, prepare documentation, consider co-applicant if needed, and lock rates or plan prepayments if extra cash arises."
