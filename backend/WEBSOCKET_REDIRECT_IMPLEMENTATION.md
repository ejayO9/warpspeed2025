# WebSocket Redirect Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented a WebSocket-based system to send redirect commands from the backend to the frontend when users confirm they want to proceed with loan analysis.

## Architecture

### Backend Components

1. **WebSocket Manager** (`app/services/websocket_manager.py`)
   - Manages WebSocket connections per user
   - Key methods:
     - `connect()` - Accept new connections
     - `disconnect()` - Remove connections
     - `send_redirect()` - Send redirect commands to specific users

2. **WebSocket Endpoint** (`app/agents/router.py`)
   - `/agent/ws/{user_id}` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication
   - `/agent/test-redirect` - HTTP endpoint for testing

3. **LangGraph Integration** (`app/agents/graph.py`)
   - When user confirms analysis, the conversation agent:
     - Sets `user_confirmed_analysis = True` in state
     - Calls `manager.send_redirect(user_id, "/analysis")`

### Frontend Components

1. **WebSocket Hook** (`src/hooks/useWebSocket.js`)
   - Custom React hook that:
     - Establishes WebSocket connection
     - Handles redirect messages
     - Auto-reconnects on disconnect
     - Uses React Router's `navigate()` for redirects

2. **HelloPage Integration** (`src/pages/HelloPage.js`)
   - Uses the WebSocket hook with the user's session ID
   - Removed old SSE-based redirect handling

## How It Works

1. When user opens the chat page:
   - Frontend generates a unique user ID
   - WebSocket connection is established using this ID

2. During conversation:
   - User provides financial information to Agent1
   - Agent1 asks: "Shall I analyze your loan options now?"

3. When user confirms (says "yes", "sure", "proceed", etc.):
   - Agent1 detects the confirmation
   - Calls `manager.send_redirect(user_id, "/analysis")`
   - WebSocket message is sent to the frontend

4. Frontend receives redirect:
   - WebSocket hook processes the message
   - Automatically navigates to `/analysis` page

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start backend server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Open `test_websocket.html` in browser
3. Connect and test redirect buttons

### With the App
1. Start backend and frontend
2. Go to chat page
3. Provide all required information
4. Confirm when asked to analyze
5. Should automatically redirect to analysis page

## Benefits
- Clean separation of concerns
- Real-time communication
- Works for both text and voice chat
- Reliable with auto-reconnect
- Can be extended for other real-time features
