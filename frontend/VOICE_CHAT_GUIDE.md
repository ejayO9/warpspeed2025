# Voice Chat Controls Guide

## Button Controls

The chat interface now has two separate buttons in the header:

### 1. Microphone Toggle (Left Button)
- **Green with Mic icon** - Your microphone is ON and the agent can hear you
- **Red with MicOff icon** - Your microphone is MUTED and the agent cannot hear you
- This button is always visible and can be toggled at any time
- Use this to temporarily mute yourself during a voice chat session

### 2. Voice Chat Toggle (Right Button)
- **Purple with Phone icon** - Click to START a voice chat session
- **Red with PhoneOff icon** - Click to END the voice chat session
- This button controls the voice chat connection itself

## How to Use

1. **Start Voice Chat**: Click the purple phone button
2. **Mute/Unmute**: Click the mic button to toggle your microphone on/off
3. **End Voice Chat**: Click the red phone-off button

## Notes

- The mic button only works when voice chat is active
- Muting your mic prevents the agent from hearing you but keeps the voice session active
- You can still hear the agent's responses when your mic is muted
- Text input is disabled during voice chat sessions
